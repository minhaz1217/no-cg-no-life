# No CG No Life - EWU

#### The purpose for this is to have a community driven open source project which aims to make an app that will be beneficial for the students of East West University where the students themselves will be the maintainer.



As of now, we hope to add these features in our flutter app:

1. Organized web urls to redirect the users to proper locations for the updated information about the topics.
2. A clubs sections to highlight different clubs, their groups, pages etc. (URL redirection)
3. CGPA Calculator
4. Advising planner to generate non conflicting class schedules for students.
5. Ability to add day to day class schedules.
6. Light/Dark mode for viewing comfort.
7. Customizable landing page.


This will be the first phase for this app. Hopefully I will be able to complete it within my very limited free time.
